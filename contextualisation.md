## Travel and Tourism ##

One benefit is that an AI could be trained using neural networks and thermal cameras in order to help identify people with high temperatures who are possibly ill, slowing down COVID-19 transmissions. Another benefit is that with instant object recognition combined with advancements in fluoroscopy, moderation in airports could be improved and at rare times prevent catastrophes. However, excessive use of this technology which is not perfect could lead to incorrect judgements.

## Gaming and Entertainment ##

In gaming, instant object recognition can allow people to interact with video games with gestures and other movements without ever needing external equipment such as VR headsets. Similarly, in other entertainment platforms, users could interact with applications with no contact with the device, potentially improving convenience drastically. However, an ethical and possibly illegal issue with this is that companies may gather data about the user's physical appearance and turn it into information about race, gender, age and more without the user's permission.

## Education and Learning ##

One way computer vision can be very helpful for teachers, is that by thoroughly training a neural network, it could be able to recognize behavior and engagement of students in classes, detecting when they're not focused on tasks and monitoring that. It can also help detecting and moderating the objects that students bring into schools such as weapons as it can be difficult for humans in such crowded areas. It can also moderate cheating in exams, possibly not pinpoint it but recognize unidentified papers or students talking to others. However, as previously stated, AI is not perfect, so this could lead to cases where it is inaccurate and monitor incorrect data.

## Transport and Navigation ##

Already seen in today's world, computer vision can be very applicable to transport and navigation. It is a necessity for object recognition to be instant when creating self-driving vehicles, for safety and correct travelling/driving. With enough advancements in computer vision, self-driving cars may even reduce the number of accidents on the road, by recognizing imminent crashes faster than a human could thanks to predictions and calculations using data about objects in the surroundings. Although self-driving cars may be more convenient, it could potentially risk cyber security issues as hackers could find ways to manipulate self-driving systems on other cars and hijack them.

## Medicine and Healthcare ##

Computer vision could be used to scan images of a person's cell tissues and identify different types of cells and viruses. This could help diagnose and treat diseases faster and more accurately. It could also be used in surgeries, scanning the person's body and also identify surgical tools, which could help guide surgeons during these operations.
